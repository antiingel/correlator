# Correlator for finding correlated time series

## Introduction

This repository contains code our team developed during the [M4 forecasting competition](https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/m4/). Details are given in the [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2019.02.018): Anti Ingel, Novin Shahroudi, Markus Kängsepp, Andre Tättar, Viacheslav Komisarenko and Meelis Kull. "Correlated daily time series and forecasting in the M4
competition". International Journal of Forecasting 36.1 (2020). M4 Competition. Please cite this article when using our code.

## Getting Started

Before trying to run the code, please download the required dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o7xC4j2ai01st8dL_KUcM6gB_ThPpPrF). The original dataset can also be found [here](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M4-methods/tree/master/Dataset), but using the previous link is recommended, because it contains folder structure required by the code. Extract content of `correlator.zip` to the same folder that contains `src`.

### Content of `correlator.zip`

The `data` folder contains the original dataset (in folder `full`) and our internal train-test split (in folder `holdout`). There is also `M4info.csv` file which contains information about the time series.

The `forecasts` folder contains the forecasts that our code produces with different settings. In more detail:
 * folder `single_methods` contains forecasts for 5 models (2 ARIMA models, ETS, Naive and a custom method),
 * folder `ensemble` contains forecasts of our ensemble of the 5 single methods and also forecasts of a combination of ensemble and correlator,
 * folder `correlator` contains forecasts of the correlator.
 
The content of `scores` folder is organised similarly to `forecasts` folder and it contains MASE, sMAPE and OWA performance measures (see [here](https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/M4-Competitors-Guide.pdf) for details) for the corresponding forecasts in `forecasts` folder. In addition, it contains a folder `analysis` which has MASE, sMAPE and OWA for different similarity categories that our analysis revealed (see our article for more details).

Finally, the folder `correlations` has two subfolders. The first subfolder `analysis` contains information about "global" correlations that our method found and the second subfolder `correlator` contains information about "local" correlations that our method found.

### Content of `src`

1. Folder `single_methods` contains code for all of the single method based predictors except Naive. They reads data from `data/full/train` and produces forecasts into `forecasts/single_methods` folder. Custom method also uses the holdout data.
2. Folder `ensemble` contains the code of ensemble. File `ensemble.py` reads input data from `forecasts/single_methods` and produces forecasts into `forecasts/ensemble` folder. File `replace_correlated.py` can be used after running the correlator to replace some of the ensemble forecasts with correlator forecasts. It reads correlation information from `correlations/correlator` and forecasts from `forecasts/ensemble` and `forecasts/correlator`.
3. Folder `correlator` contains code of the correlator. It reads data from `data/full/train` and writes found correlations into `correlations/correlator` and corresponding forecasts into `forecasts/correlator`.
4. Folder `correlations_analysis` contains code used to find "global" correlations. File `cross_correlation.py` reads data from `data/full/train` and writes found correlations into `correlations/analysis`. File `filter_correlations.py` simulates manual filtering we did to the correlations found by `cross_correlation.py`. It reads the output of `cross_correlation.py` from `correlations/analysis` and information about which correlations to keep from `correlations/analysis/filter.csv`.
5. Folder `evaluation` contains code that is used to evaluate the results. It reads forecasts from the corresponding folder in `forecasts` and produces scores to corresponding folder in `scores`. In more detail, `evaluation.py` can be used to evaluate single methods and ensemble (also ensemble with correlator). File `correlator_evaluation.py` can be used to evaluate correlator results (that is only the time series for which correlator made a prediction are considered). Finally, `correlation_analysis_evaluation.py` can be used to find MASE, sMAPE and OWA for different similarity categories that our analysis revealed.
